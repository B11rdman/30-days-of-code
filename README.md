# 30 Days of Code

PLEASE

Don't just copy and paste the code. Try to understand the logic of the code and how it solves the problem.

Here I collected my solutions for HackerRank's '30 Days of Code' challenge.

All the solutions are written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

I don't insist that my solutions are the best ones, but they are good enough to get 30/30 from each problem.
